# CHIP-8 emulator
This is my attempt at creating a Chip-8 emulator in c.

The program requires the SDL library and can be compiled with a C compiler.

The desired file to open is given as a command line argument. For example,  
./main.exe Pong.ch8  
to run the file Pong.ch8, or  
./main.exe Puzzle.ch8 -v  
to run the file Puzzle.ch8 and include verbose outputs.
